Tings started with that I need to finish my first TimeCodeRunner exercise. I was lost when I opened the second question.

#### Question
*Given a two-digit number, write a program that retrieves the "tens" digit, retrieves the "units" digit, and prints the number in reverse order.*

## Code Belowï¼š

```python
n=input("Please input a number you wanna reversed: ") 
num=int(n)
rev=0  #define a variable rev and assign value to 0
while(num>0):
    rev=(rev*10)+(num%10)
    num=num//10
 
print("The number you input is %s, the reversed number is %s." %(n,rev))

```
